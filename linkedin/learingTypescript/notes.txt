* Typescript
    - typed superset of JavaScript
        - large applications
    - transpiler    
        - converts JS to TS
        - compiles TS to JS

* Dynamic Typing
    - varibales may be assigned (and reassigned) to any type value
    - field may be added to objects by assigning it to them

* Static Typing
    - variables are assigned to a specific type and this cannot be changed

    - catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
    - better tooling (refactoring, autocomplete, and so on)
    - explicitly express intent
        - make sure we know what we are writing for
