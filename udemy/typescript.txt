* What is Typescript
    - Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, built with JavaScript
    - Typescript is a "transpiler", which means it takes TypeScript code and converts it to JavaScript code
        - browsers cannot understand Typescript code, but they can understand JavaScript code
    - Typescript is used to avoid compile and runtime errors
    - Static language typing, which means that variables and functions are typed and cannot be reassigned to another type

* Overview of TypeScript
    - adds Types
    - non JavaScript features like Interfaces, Classes, Generics, Modules, etc.
    - next-gen JavaScript features early
    - meta-programming features like decorators
    - lots of configurable options
    - modern tooling

* Types
    - number, ex. 1, 5.3, -10
    - string, ex. 'hi', "hi", `hi`
    - boolean, ex. true, false, null, undefined
    - array, ex. [1, 2, 3]

    "typeof" operator
        - returns the type of a variable
        - ex. typeof 1 === 'number'
