* What is Typescript
    - Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, built with JavaScript
    - Typescript is a "transpiler", which means it takes TypeScript code and converts it to JavaScript code
        - browsers cannot understand Typescript code, but they can understand JavaScript code
    - Typescript is used to avoid compile and runtime errors
    - Static language typing, which means that variables and functions are typed and cannot be reassigned to another type

* Overview of TypeScript
    - adds Types
    - non JavaScript features like Interfaces, Classes, Generics, Modules, etc.
    - next-gen JavaScript features early
    - meta-programming features like decorators
    - lots of configurable options
    - modern tooling

* Types
    - number: all numbers, ex. 1, 5.3, -10
    - string: all text values, ex. 'hi', "hi", `hi`
    - boolean: just two - no truthy or falsy values, ex. true, false, null, undefined
    - array: flexible or strict, ex. [1, 2, 3]
    - object: JS object - more specific types, ex. {name: 'hi'}
    - tuple: fixed length array, ex. [1, 'hi']
    - enum: fixed set of values, ex. enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
    - void: no return value
    - null and undefined: null and undefined are the same
    - Function: a function with a return type
    - never: function that never returns, nothing is EVER going to be returned (ex. throw new Error())

    - any: can be anything
    - unknown: can be anything, but we dont know or care
        - you can swtich types with ANY but not with UNKNOWN
        - ANY allows the variable to take any type it wants
        - UKNOWN is only one type but we dont know what type it is specifically

    "typeof" operator
        - returns the type of a variable
        - ex. typeof 1 === 'number'

    - TS types are checked at compliation type and JS at runtime
